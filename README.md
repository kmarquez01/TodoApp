# Todoapp

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

This is a TodoApp which was built using React Js coupled with HTML and CSS. My goal with this app was to understand how to implement data from an API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1/todos) while also being able to update future state inputs. As a result, I know how to access user input data in real time and make applications run more smoothly and interactively.

The main functionalities include what is typical of a todo app: adding a task, deleting a task, and editing a task.
